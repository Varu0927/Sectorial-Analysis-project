                                                    Project Title: District-Wise Sectoral Analysis of Indian States
Dataset file name: District-Wise Sectoral Analysis of Indian States
Students will work on a dataset that provides a detailed district-wise sectoral analysis of various Indian states across multiple years. The dataset captures economic contributions
from three major sectors—Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary—at both constant and currentprices, along with their respective shares in each district’s economy. Students will analyze
this data using SQL, focusing on identifying trends, relationships, and sector-wise growth across different districts and states.


Dataset Information(Data Dictionary):
The dataset contains the following columns:
1. Dist Code: District code.
2. Year: The year of analysis.
3. State Code: State code.
4. State Name: Name of the state.
5. Dist Name: Name of the district.
6. Primary Sector (Constant Prices): Contribution of the primary sector at constant
prices (in Million Rs).
7. Primary Sector (Current Prices): Contribution of the primary sector at current prices
(in Million Rs).
8. Primary Sector (Constant Shares): Share of the primary sector at constant prices
(in %).
9. Primary Sector (Current Shares): Share of the primary sector at current prices (in
%).
10. Secondary Sector (Constant Prices): Contribution of the secondary sector at
constant prices (in Million Rs).
11. Secondary Sector (Current Prices): Contribution of the secondary sector at current
prices (in Million Rs).
12. Secondary Sector (Constant Shares): Share of the secondary sector at constant
prices (in %).
13. Secondary Sector (Current Shares): Share of the secondary sector at current
prices (in %).
14. Tertiary Sector (Constant Prices): Contribution of the tertiary sector at constant
prices (in Million Rs).
15. Tertiary Sector (Current Prices): Contribution of the tertiary sector at current prices
(in Million Rs).
16. Tertiary Sector (Constant Shares): Share of the tertiary sector at constant prices (in
%).
17. Tertiary Sector (Current Shares): Share of the tertiary sector at current prices (in
%).
18. Total Constant Prices: Total contribution of all sectors at constant prices (in Million
Rs).
19. Total Current Prices: Total contribution of all sectors at current prices (in Million Rs).
20. Per Capita Current Prices: Per capita contribution at current prices (in Rs).

Instructions:
1. Objective: Use SQL to perform queries on the dataset. Analyze sector-wise
performance, identify trends, and generate insights across districts and states.
2. Expected Outcome: Provide meaningful insights such as the growth of sectors over
time, comparison of district performance, and identifying trends at the state and
district level.
3. Tools can be used: SQL Workbench, DBeaver, MySQL, Postgres, any RDB based
Database., Power BI/Tableau for Visualization.
Queries to be answered:
1. Basic Query: Retrieve all data for a specific state, e.g., "Chhattisgarh."
2. Filtering: Show all the districts in a given state that had a total contribution of more
than 100,000 million Rs at current prices in a particular year.
3. Aggregation: Find the total contribution of the primary sector across all districts for a
given year.
4. Join Operation: Write a query to join district data with state codes and names to
display state-wise analysis.
5. Growth Calculation: Calculate the year-on-year growth of the secondary sector for a
specific district.
6. Trend Analysis: Identify the district with the highest growth rate in the tertiary sector
over a five-year period.
7. Group By: Group data by state to calculate the total contribution of the secondary
sector in constant prices for each state.
8. Comparison: Compare the per capita current prices between two districts over the
same year.
9. Ranking: Rank districts within a state based on their total constant prices for a given
year.
10. Filtering by Sector: Find the districts where the primary sector's share in constant
prices is higher than 20% in the latest year.
11. Sector Performance: For each state, calculate the average share of the tertiary
sector (current prices) over the entire time period.
12. Max-Min Analysis: Identify the district with the highest and lowest total current
prices for a given year.
13. Percentage Contribution: Calculate the percentage contribution of the secondary
sector to the total economy for each district.
14. Conditional Filtering: List all districts where the tertiary sector constant share is
greater than the secondary sector constant share for a specific year.
15. Multi-Condition Query: Write a query to display districts where the primary and
secondary sector shares are both greater than 30%.
16. Time Series Analysis: Show how the total contribution at current prices has
changed over time for a specific district.
17. Subquery: Write a subquery to find the state that contributed the most in the tertiary
sector at current prices for a given year.
18. Distinct Query: Find all the unique states present in the dataset.
19. Join and Aggregate: Join state and district data and calculate the total economic
contribution for a particular state across all its districts for a given year.

20. Window Functions: Use a window function to calculate the cumulative total of the
primary sector at constant prices for a district over the years.

Deliverables:
1. SQL queries answering the above questions.
2. Insights generated from running the queries.
3. A report summarizing the key findings and trends for each state and district.
